            The goal of this project was to pick, and manipulate images for a 
            client who advocated for a political cause. This Python project was 
            considered as one of the harder projects in the year, as it needed 
            much extra research and more complex code, not to mention that our 
            teacher was absent for the weeks this project was assigned. My team 
            decided to base our project off of the political cause to legalize 
            testing of self-driving cars in all states of the US. We chose to 
            create our project from this cause because it could potentially save
            many lives as well as prevent many car accidents in the future. My 
            team started off the Image Manipulation Project by choosing pictures
            to actually manipulate for our client. These pictures were mainly 
            self-driving cars or someone driving a self-driving car. My partner 
            and I planned to have the user be able to decide what manipulations
            they wanted, and whatever manipulation was desired would be done on 
            all of the images. Our image manipulations include: grayscaled image
            with logo; bordered image made from the utilization of masks; a 
            customizable border; a triple border; and a distorted image. Along 
            with weeks and weeks worth of coding, documentation was key. 
            Everyday, we had to record down the changes we made to the project 
            as well as how we made those changes. We also needed to make an 
            organized and very consistent document overall to obtain a good 
            grade on the project. This project taught me how to code with 
            modules, objects, and classes in Python.
