          <p>Why do we humans have goals in life? Hello, my name is TinhPhong, and I 
          attend Dublin High School. My long-term goal is to become a 
          successful Principal Software Engineer. My plan 
          for reaching this goal is simple, but it will require diligence. I plan to graduate high school 
          and average at least a 4.3 GPA. When I get into college, I 
          will take the classes that I will need to graduate with a Computer Science Major, and I might even take 
          extra classes in the business or economics field. After graduating from college, I 
          will earn a job as a computer scientist, and continue my journey towards a happy life.   
          </p>
      
          <p>My strengths that relate to this career are ambition and independence. 
          In all tests, assignments, and projects, I always am determined to get the 
          highest score possible, and when I don't get the score that I want, I study
          and work harder to attain my desired score. My ambition will help me achieve 
          this goal because when I have a desire for this career, I will work harder 
          and harder until I get it. I am extremely independent because I do a lot of 
          activities and work for myself, from doing the laundry, to washing the dishes, and even 
          cooking. An independent mindset will help me achieve my goal because it 
          will be one of the most important skills for a software engineer as every 
          person with a job needs to be able to be responsible and diligent towards their work. 
          Additionally, I can program applications with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and MIT 
          App Inventor. My ability to code and think through algorithms will definately help me succeed in the engineering field.
          </p>
      
          <p>I have had many accomplishments. One of them 
          is getting preety high grades in highschool, where my first B ever was in my Junior year. I have managed to obtain a 4.33 GPA in my Sophomore year, Junior year, and Senior year of Highschool along with a 4.0 in my Freshman year. 
          An additional accomplishment
          of mine includes being a leader in a youth group for over two years. Also, I have helped develop the Vitenamese Student Association club, and I have been the Vice President of this club for over 3 semesters, and I am the current President. 
          These accomplishments have taught me many 
          things. My experience as a youth group leader taught me how effective a team could be with the use of good 
          communication, while getting excellent grades taught me that working hard 
          is worth it, and this is not because of the rewards earned, but because of the further opportunities that I obtain. 
          </p>
            
          <p>I have a goal to become a software engineer. I have many accomplishments 
          throughout my life. Everything that I have experienced through life has
          taught me many things that make me the person I am today. My website 
          represents who I am, so check out my other fascinating pages.
