          <p>Why do us as humans have goals in life? Hello, my name is TinhPhong, and I 
          attend Dublin High School. My long-term goal is to become a 
          successful entrepreneur who makes enough money to live... My plan 
          for reaching this goal is simple. I will first graduate from high school 
          and attempt to average higher than a 4.0 GPA. When I get into college, I 
          will take the classes that I will need to graduate with a Computer Science Major, and maybe even take 
          extra classes about creating your own business. After graduating college, I 
          will create multiple online businesses where I buy, sell, and fix 
          computer parts. This is my dream job because as an entrepreneur people 
          have the potential to: make a lot of money; live a happy life; as well as learn a lot of new               
          skills.  
          </p>
      
          <p>My strengths that relate to this career are ambition and independence. 
          In all tests, assignments, and projects, I always am determined to get the 
          highest score possible, and when I don't get the score that I want, I study
          and work harder to get my desired score. My ambition will help me achieve 
          this goal because when I have a desire for this career, I will work harder 
          and harder until I get it. I am extremely independent because I do a lot of 
          things for myself, from doing the laundry, to washing the dishes, and even 
          cooking. This independence will help me achieve my goal because it 
          will be one of the most important skills for an entrepreneur since every 
          entrepreneur creates their own business. You must know how to take care 
          of yourself and do things by yourself before creating your own business.
          </p>
      
          <p>I have had many accomplishments. One of them 
          is getting a GPA of 4.0 and Principal's Honor Roll from 6th to 9th grade. 
          Never getting a B makes me prideful and more ambitious to get all A's. 
          Over the summer, I also packaged food for hungry kids all over Asia and Africa
          in a non-profit organization called Kids Against Hunger. Another accomplishment
          of mine is making the Wells 8th grade basketball team. There were about 40 kids
          that tried out for the team, and I was one of the 13 people who made the team. 
          Besides making the basketball team, helping my team make the playoffs was a 
          true accomplishment as well. All of these accomplishments have taught me many 
          things. Making the basketball team taught me how effective a team could be if 
          communication was good. Better communication made better executions of plays 
          in basketball. Getting a 4.0 GPA for 3 years straight taught me that working hard 
          is worth it. Not because of the rewards I get, but because it makes me
          feel good about myself as a person. 
          </p>
            
          <p>I have a goal to become an entrepreneur. I have many accomplishments 
          throughout my life. Everything that I have experienced through life has
          taught me many things that make me the person I am today. My website 
          represents who I am, so check out my other fascinating pages.
