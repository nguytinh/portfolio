          <p>Why do we humans have goals in life? Hello, my name is Tinh-Phong, and I 
          attend California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. My long-term goal is to become a 
          successful Principal Computer Engineer. My plan 
          for reaching this goal is simple, but it will require diligence. Firstly, I plan to graduate college with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering while juggling a couple of internships on the way there. I then want to earn myself a variety of positions in the Cyber Security field and work my way up the ranks as a valuable asset. Even farther down the future, I want to utilize the money I save and start a business with my brother and cousin. 
          </p>
      
          <p>My strengths that relate to this career are ambition and independence. 
          In all tests, assignments, and projects, I am always determined to get the 
          highest score possible, and when I don't get the score that I want, I study
          and work harder to attain my desired score. My ambition will help me achieve 
          this goal because when I have a desire for this career, I will work harder 
          and harder until I get it. I am extremely independent because I do a lot of 
          activities and work for myself. An open mindset will help me achieve my goal because it 
          will be one of the most important skills for an engineer as every 
          person with a job needs to be able to be responsible and diligent towards their work. 
          Additionally, I can program applications with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and MIT 
          App Inventor. My ability to code and think through algorithms will definitely help me succeed in the engineering field.
          </p>
      
          <p>I have had many accomplishments. Considering that I am just in my first year of college, many of these accomplishments are from my later years in high school and early months in college. My most notable achievement at the moment is obtaining a high GPA of 3.937 in my first quarter of college. This first quarter of school was the most challenging time of my life. Not only was I trying to adapt to a new college life; right after being stuck in a pandemic, but I also pledged for the Sigma Phi Delta fraternity this quarter. This fraternity is a social and professional fraternity for Engineers like me, and the pledging process took hours of my time everyday. Nevertheless, I was still able to maintain a solid GPA in the most challenging quarter of my life, which later helped me earn a $4500 MCS scholarship.    
          </p>
            
          <p>I have a goal to become a successful engineer. Everything that I have experienced through life has
          taught me many things that make me the person I am today. My website 
          represents who I am, so check out my other fascinating pages.
