        <h3>Patriot Jet Team Foundation</h3>
        <p>    During my experience in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, I have met multiple industry professionals through field trips and guest speakers. One of the field trip opportunities that I have attended is to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation, where I learned about the functionality of a successful plane, as well as the parts of historical planes. This includes specific design modifications such as fixing drag as well as pitch problems in a plane by turning elevators behind the tail into stabilators. This improvement helped engineers construct a plane that could break the speed of sound without collapsing. Also, wings began to become swept back to decrease drag. After being able to break the speed of sound which is Mach 1, people began to want planes to go even faster, so they applied something called the Area Rule. This made it so that drag would be greatly decreased on jets. During this field trip, I learned a lot about the aerospace industry, but I also met new people, such as Ed and Poul who were the main coordinators of the field trip. The aspects of this trip that made it memorable were the cool opportunities I had to further learn about planes after the lecture. This includes being able to enter one of the stunt planes and testing a plane simulation software. </p>

        <h3>Livermore Aviation Tour</h3>
        <p>Because of limitations with Covid-19 and the pandemic, the school year of 2020-2021 was forced to adjust to an online distance learning format. This includes the field trips that were planned throughout the year. One of the first field trips of the year that I went on was the Livermore Aviation Tour. Although I was not able to go directly to the Livermore Aviation buildings, we were able to learn about the area and what it has to offer via Zoom (an online video calling application). Not only did we learn about the aerodynamics in some of their planes, but we also got a deep dive into the workerâ€™s lives as well how the Flight school really operated as well as adjusted from Covid-19. I was able to talk to various managers at Livermore Aviation, and we were able to see what it looks like when a pilot is being trained. Overall the experience here was amazing and it was very interesting to look into other fields of engineering. </p>

        <h3>Water Treatment Plant Tour</h3>
        <p>Another virtual field trip that I went to this year was the Water Treatment Plant Tour, where I was able to observe and look at the various buildings, machines, and operations used to filter and treat water in the San Ramon/Pleasanton area. The main goal of this organization is to protect public health and the environment by providing clean, accessible, and cost-effective water, recycled water, and wastewater services. Students were able to explore many different loud machines that filtered water as dissolved particles such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals are removed using filters made of sand, gravel, and charcoal. Chlorine or chloramine is often added to clean the water, killing parasites, bacteria, viruses, and germs. This field trip displayed the amount of work and challenges that workers face even through simple processes of cleaning water and making the environment better.</p>

        <h3>ROCHE Stem Career Days</h3>
        <p>The ROCHE STEM Career Days were my final field trip of the year, where I learned more about the Biomedical field than the Engineering field. ROCHE is a medical device company that focuses on creativity. The main subject of this virtual field trip was Covid-19 and the vaccine. They consist of a multitude of laboratories that help them discover faster techniques of testing, better distribution of the vaccine, and much more. Like many other companies, they go through a process analyzing Feasibility, Verification, Validation, Manufacturability, and finally approval. With further research on the company, I discovered that they have a large focus on PCR, or Polymerase chain reaction, and this enables reliable diagnoses and monitoring of diseases. The technology is Nobel-Prize winning, and will further help the world become a healthier and safer place. </p>

        <p>    Other than field trips, I have also met many industry professionals during guest speaker presentations. One influential speaker that I got a chance to learn about was Emma Schoenthal. She is a Civil Engineer who graduated from UCSD (University of California San Diego) and also attended my current high school, Dublin High School. Emma Schoenthal came into UCSD undeclared, and graduated with a Bachelors's Degree in Environmental Engineering. Not only am I inspired by her dedication and success in the STEM field, but she also attended one of the colleges that I strive to go to in the near future. Another inspiration that I have gained from her career is her flexibility in engineering fields. She majored in Environmental Engineering after college; however, she is currently working as a Civil Engineer. This gives me hope for the future as I want to be that flexible when it comes to my profession.</p>
        <p>    Another industry professional that I met was Andrea Madotto. He is a PhD candidate in Electronic & Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and part of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE) and ML Collective (MLC). Conversational modeling, controllable language production, and meta/continual learning are among his research interests. During that time that Madotto gave us his lecture, I was also working on creating a Chatbot with Java for my APCSA class. His excellence in machine learning and artificial intelligence gave me a great inspiration on what my chatbot would eventually become, however I have still yet to incorporate a true machine learning program into the chatbot. Along with helping us with our own chatbots, Madotto also displayed some other extremely advanced chatbots that were able to actually understand the Enlish language. Overall the experience with Madotto was very inspiring, helpful, and educational.</p>
        <p>    Two more guest speakers that I have been able to listen to throughout my high school career are Lakshmi Hanspal, and Jason Yosinski. Lakshmi Hanspal is the Global CSO (Chief Security Officer) of Amazon, she is a Board Director, and she is an Award Winning Executive. Jason Yosinski is a professional in Machine Learning. He is the president of the ML Collective Research group, and he is a scientific advisor to Recursion Pharmaceuticals. Lakshmi Hanspal gave us a deep dive into AWS (Amazon Web Services), and its ability to give computing power, storage, and ambient intelligence. She explained how it is used in many things that we do today, one example being video games and peekers advantage. AWS has helped many video games fix server delays, making gameplay more equal, especially at the professional level. Hanspal also gave us insight on Amazon projects such as Astro, Alexa boarding Artemis 1, Echo dot, and Zooks. Jason Yosinski helped us understand more about machine learning, the main basis being inputting data into a machine, which helps algorithms teach the computer. Jason showed us one of his projects on a robot that used machine learning to walk. The use of geometric patterns and neural networks helped the robot eventually learn how to walk efficiently. Overall I learned a tremendous amount from both guest speakers that would help me succeed in the STEM field.</p>
        <p>    In addition to the industry professionals that I have met, I have also had a good amount of real work experience. Ever since the summer of 2018, I have been working for a high-tech eBay business called 4yourbusiness. I mainly work during long breaks, or sometimes on weekends as an Operations Technician. My main tasks include: testing hard drives, servers and switches; packaging switches or servers; and organizing machine part numbers. I have diligently worked in this company for at least 400 hours which displays my ability to listen, my precise execution of tasks, and teamworking ability in a professional workplace. Although this job does not have much to do with my goal to be a software engineer, it has given me many experiences that will benefit me in the future.</p>
        <p>    Finally, as part of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, it is normal for Juniors to get mentors to help guide them as they progress through their future and career. My mentor is Aniket Saoji. Aniket earned a Bachelors in Computer Science, and minor in Philosophy from Boston College, and he now works as a Product Manager at Workday. He was a former Computer Scientist/Software Engineer there, so he has a lot of experience in the field. I believe that with his expertise in the field as well as his keenness to help me reach my goals, I will have no problem creating a successful carreer for myself.</p>
