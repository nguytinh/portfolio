        <h3>Patriot Jett Team Foundation</h3>
        <p>    During my experience in the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, I have met multiple industry professionals through field trips and guest speakers. One of the field trip opportunities that I have attended is to the Patriot Jet Team Foundation, where I learned about the functionality of a successful plane, as well as the parts of historical planes. This includes specific design modifications such as fixing drag as well as pitch problems in a plane by turning elevators behind the tail into stabilators. This improvement helped engineers construct a plane that could break the speed of sound without collapsing. Also, wings began to become swept back to decrease drag. After being able to break the speed of sound which is Mach 1, people began to want planes to go even faster, so they applied something called the Area Rule. This made it so that drag would be greatly decreased on jets. During this field trip, I learned a lot about the aerospace industry, but I also met new people, such as Ed and Poul who were the main coordinators of the field trip. The aspects of this trip that made it memorable were the cool opportunities I had to further learn about planes after the lecture. This includes being able to enter one of the stunt planes and testing a plane simulation software. </p>

        <p>    Other than field trips, I have also met many industry professionals during guest speaker presentations. One influential speaker that I got a chance to learn about was Emma Schoenthal. She is a Civil Engineer who graduated from UCSD (University of California San Diego) and also attended my current high school, Dublin High School. Emma Schoenthal came into UCSD undeclared, and graduated with a Bachelors's Degree in Environmental Engineering. Not only am I inspired by her dedication and success in the STEM field, but she also attended one of the colleges that I strive to go to in the near future. Another inspiration that I have gained from her career is her flexibility in engineering fields. She majored in Environmental Engineering after college; however, she is currently working as a Civil Engineer. This gives me hope for the future as I want to be that flexible when it comes to my profession.</p>
        <p>    Another industry professional that I met was ____.</p>
        <p>    In addition to the industry professionals that I have met, I have also had a good amount of real work experience. Ever since the summer of 2018, I have been working for a high-tech eBay business called 4yourbusiness. I mainly work during long breaks, or sometimes on weekends as an Operations Technician. My main tasks include: testing hard drives, servers and switches; packaging switches or servers; and organizing machine part numbers. I have diligently worked in this company for at least 400 hours which displays my ability to listen, my precise execution of tasks, and teamworking ability in a professional workplace. Although this job does not have much to do with my goal to be a software engineer, it has given me many experiences that will benefit me in the future.</p>
