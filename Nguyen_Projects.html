            This is my App Inventor Project, which was an assigned project in my 
            Computer Science Principles 
            class. The goal of this project was to modify a bland and simple game into
            a complex and fun game. I worked on this project with my partner Juan Jose.
            The game was called Oh My Spikes. This project needed a lot of creativity 
            from Juan and I since you needed to change a game with no cool attributes 
            into one that was actually entertaining and fun to play. Not to mention 
            that Juan and I didn't have any knowledge whatsoever on how to use MIT App 
            Inventor, so we had to make new features to the game while trying to figure
            out what each block of code did. Every day we would discuss and show each 
            other how certain blocks of code work. We didn't continue making modifications 
            until we fully understood the code. With my design creativity and exemplary 
            communication with Juan, we were able to earn an A on the project. Our modifications 
            for Oh My Spikes consisted of 3 new enemies
            for the bird, 2 that bounced around the screen and one that moved up and down, 4
            different power-ups, coins scattered around the screen, and an instructions 
            button that you could click on for the instructions to Oh My Spikes. This project
            taught me a lot. I learned how to make sprites bounce around the edge of the 
            canvas, move up and down, and spawn 
            randomly on the screen. I didn't just learn how to use MIT App Inventor. During
            the course of the project, I also learned how to have better communication by 
            getting to know your partner better, and talking to your partner a lot about 
            what you plan to do. All in all, this is my App Inventor Project.
